I will refine and expand the documentation across Stages 00-06 by adding detailed practical case studies and visual aids to key files.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Roadmap (Stage 00-01)
1.  **Refine `docs/guide/00-roadmap.md`**:
    *   Add a **Mermaid Flowchart** to visually represent the dependency and flow between stages.
2.  **Refine `docs/guide/01-math-basics/01-linear-algebra.md`**:
    *   Add a **"Practical Case: Image Compression with SVD"** section.
    *   Include complete, runnable Python code using `numpy` and `matplotlib` to demonstrate how matrix decomposition compresses data.

### Phase 2: Data & Machine Learning (Stage 02-03)
3.  **Refine `docs/guide/02-python-data/02-pandas.md`**:
    *   Add a **"Practical Case: E-commerce Sales Analysis"** section.
    *   Include a scenario simulating sales data processing: Cleaning, GroupBy aggregation (Monthly Sales), and Basic Visualization.
4.  **Refine `docs/guide/03-ml-basics/04-classification.md`**:
    *   Add a **"Practical Case: Titanic Survival Prediction"** section.
    *   Walk through a complete workflow: Data Loading -> Feature Selection -> Logistic Regression Model -> Accuracy Evaluation.

### Phase 3: Deep Learning (Stage 04)
5.  **Refine `docs/guide/04-deep-learning/01-neural-networks.md`**:
    *   Add a **"Practical Case: Designing a Neural Network for MNIST"** section.
    *   Visualize the network architecture (Input -> Hidden -> Output) and provide a PyTorch implementation snippet for the model structure.

### Phase 4: Advanced Applications (Stage 05-06)
6.  **Refine `docs/guide/05-llm-apps/04-rag.md`**:
    *   Expand the code section into a **"Mini-Project: Building a Private Knowledge Base QA System"**.
    *   Provide a consolidated, copy-pasteable script that combines Document Loading, Splitting, Embedding, and Retrieval.
7.  **Refine `docs/guide/06-ai-engineering/01-model-serving.md`**:
    *   Expand the FastAPI example into a **"Production-Ready Project Structure"**.
    *   Show how to organize a real project (routers, schemas, services) rather than just a single file script.
